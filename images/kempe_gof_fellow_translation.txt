[note: including 3 MSEK funding and 50 kSEK personal prize]

The Kempe Foundations

The Gunnar Öquist Fellowship was established at Umeå University,
SLU in Umeå and the Luleå University of Technology in order to provide young
researchers with cutting-edge ideas the opportunity to peacefully work
on their research for a few years.

The Gunnar Öquist Fellow is appointed with the following motivation:

Fredrik Sandin has shown that he is able to quickly create a considerable depth
in new areas of research and inspire students to high-quality publications.
He completed his doctorate in astrophysics in 2007 and continued along the same line
of research with a post-doctoral stay in Liège, Belgium.
The next postdoctoral period he devoted to Brain-like computing at EISLAB
at the Luleå University of Technology, where he is now employed as an assistant professor and a driving character in Machine Learning and Brain-like computing.
He has shown a special ability to handle basic theoretical issues with a comprehensive
and powerful mathematical toolbox and to successfully apply the results in diverse industrial applications.
